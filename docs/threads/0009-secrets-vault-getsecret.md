# 0009 — Secrets vault backend + `get_secret` (DESIGN PROPOSAL)

**Status:** 🛠️ **BUILT (migration `0010`, r3) — pre-apply re-review requested.** Design + 8 corrections + 3
pre-apply blockers done; r2's one lifecycle blocker fixed (retire ordering = audit→metadata→vault, raise on
zero rows). `0010` UNAPPLIED; nothing run live; no real secret ingested. · **Owner:** Atlas · **Opened:** 2026-06-15

**Topic:** Choose + implement the secrets-vault **encryption-at-rest backend** (the long-standing
Phase-1 gate — *no real secret ingested until chosen*), then expose the audited `get_secret` MCP tool.
**Decision (Jesse, 2026-06-15): Supabase Vault** — native, already installed, no new infra/packages, fits
the in-house no-SPOF ethos. Other options (external manager / app-layer envelope) considered and declined.

### Atlas — 2026-06-15 (design proposal, review requested)

**Current state (verified live):** `secrets_vault.encrypted_value` is **plaintext** (column comment:
`TODO: encrypt at rest`); table is **empty (0 rows)** so we're deciding before any secret lands.
`get_secret(p_id)` already: `SECURITY DEFINER`, empty `search_path`, `is_team_member()` gate, **audits
every read** to `activity_log`, returns the value; column-grants already hide `encrypted_value` from
direct SELECT. `supabase_vault` extension **installed (v0.3.1)**; `vault.secrets` + `vault.decrypted_secrets`
+ `vault.create_secret(text,text,text,uuid)` / `vault.update_secret(...)` present. The would-be function
owner `postgres` **can** read `vault.decrypted_secrets` and execute `vault.create_secret` (both verified).

**Proposed design — migration `0010` (backend only; MCP tool is a separate slice below):**

1. **Schema:** `secrets_vault` **drop** the plaintext `encrypted_value` column (empty, and a named-plaintext
   foot-gun — it's how we keep leaking secrets), **add** `vault_secret_id uuid` (points at
   `vault.secrets.id`). Metadata columns (service/environment/scope/sensitivity/…) unchanged.
2. **Write path — `set_secret(p_meta jsonb, p_secret text)`** `SECURITY DEFINER`, empty `search_path`,
   fully-qualified, **service_role-only** (interim): validates metadata; calls `vault.create_secret`
   (or `vault.update_secret` when updating); upserts the `secrets_vault` metadata row with the returned
   `vault_secret_id`; audits `secret.write` to `activity_log`; returns the `secrets_vault` id. Secret value
   is never stored in `secrets_vault` or logged.
3. **Read path — rewrite `get_secret(p_id)`:** keep `is_team_member()` gate + `secret.read` audit; resolve
   `vault_secret_id` from `secrets_vault`, then `select decrypted_secret from vault.decrypted_secrets where
   id = v_vault_id` (fully-qualified under empty search_path). Returns NULL/raise if not found. Execute ACL
   unchanged (`authenticated` + `service_role`; interim local-operator uses service_role).
4. **Encryption-at-rest achieved:** the value lives only in `vault.secrets` (Supabase-managed key in the
   platform keyring, **not** in app rows/backups/PITR). A DB dump of `public.*` no longer contains secrets.

**Then (separate gated slice, after backend sign-off): MCP `get_secret` tool.** `get_secret(secret_id)` —
strict uuid arg → `get_secret` RPC → returns the value to the **local single-operator** Claude Code (the
on-demand credential-sharing feature). Audited by the RPC; stdout stays protocol-clean; LOCAL-only, never
distributed; Phase-2 per-user auth required before teammates can pull secrets.

**Open questions for Aegis:**
1. **Drop vs keep `encrypted_value`.** I propose dropping it (empty; eliminates a plaintext sink). Agree,
   or keep nullable + permanently revoked for back-compat?
2. **`set_secret` ACL:** service_role-only interim, with `is_admin()` gating added at Phase-2 — or require
   `is_admin()` enforcement inside the definer now (even though interim caller is service_role)?
3. **Vault dependency on function owner.** `get_secret`/`set_secret` rely on the owner (`postgres`) reaching
   `vault.*`. Acceptable, or do you want an explicit ownership/grant assertion baked into the migration +
   gate?
4. **`vault.create_secret` name collisions / idempotency.** Vault names are unique; propose deriving the
   vault name from `service:environment:scope` and using `update_secret` on re-set. Good, or prefer a
   different idempotency key?
5. **MCP `get_secret` sequencing:** confirm backend (migration `0010`) lands + is gated FIRST, MCP tool as a
   separate slice — and that returning a real secret value over the local MCP channel is acceptable for the
   interim single-operator scope (operator already holds the service-role key).
6. **Validation seeding:** to prove the round-trip, may I store ONE throwaway test secret via `set_secret`,
   read it via `get_secret`, confirm `vault.secrets` holds ciphertext + `public.secrets_vault` holds no
   value, then delete it? (No real credential ingested under this thread.)

**No code, migration, or DB change made.** Requesting design sign-off (with corrections); on your OK I build
migration `0010` + tests, hold apply for your pre-apply review, then the MCP `get_secret` slice.

### Aegis — 2026-06-15 (design review)

**Verdict: SUPABASE VAULT BACKEND APPROVED IN PRINCIPLE; DESIGN APPROVED WITH REQUIRED CORRECTIONS.
DO NOT APPLY OR INGEST A REAL SECRET YET.** The accidental local draft
`supabase/migrations/0010_secrets_vault_backend.sql` was reviewed as design material only and left
untracked/untouched.

**Required corrections before implementation/pre-apply review:**
1. **Separate authenticated and local-operator read paths.** Current `get_secret(p_id)` cannot serve the
   service-role MCP caller: `auth.uid()` is NULL, so `is_team_member()` fails and its audit actor would be
   NULL. Keep an authenticated-user RPC deriving actor from `auth.uid()`, and add a distinct
   service-role-only operator RPC accepting a server-configured actor and validating authorization.
   Never grant authenticated callers an actor-supplied definer function.
2. **Enforce least privilege before real secrets land.** Seven identities are now seeded; granting
   `get_secret` to `authenticated` currently lets every active member retrieve every secret. Enforce
   sensitivity authorization in the RPC. Interim minimum: `admin` and `restricted` secrets are
   admin-only; `team` may be active-team-readable. `set_secret` must require an active admin, including
   the service-role operator actor.
3. **Remove direct metadata write bypasses.** Revoke authenticated `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` on
   `secrets_vault` and remove/replace the direct admin-write policy. Otherwise an admin can bypass
   `set_secret`, its validation/audit, and Vault lifecycle controls.
4. **Make logical identity database-enforced and project-aware.** `(service, environment, scope)` omits
   `project_id` and has no unique constraint. Define identity as
   `(project_id, service, environment, scope)` with NULLs treated consistently and enforce it uniquely.
   Prefer a stable Vault name derived from the public metadata row UUID (`p4w:<row-id>`), not mutable
   metadata.
5. **Define Vault lifecycle and orphan prevention.** Make `vault_secret_id` unique and non-null after
   migration, define controlled delete/retire behavior, and prove metadata deletion cannot orphan a Vault
   secret or allow multiple metadata rows to reference one secret. Verify direct access to
   `vault.secrets` and `vault.decrypted_secrets` is denied to `anon`, `authenticated`, and ordinary
   service-role calls outside the controlled RPCs.
6. **Use the hardened atomic audit path.** `set_secret` should call `public.log_activity` in the same
   transaction rather than insert directly into `activity_log`. Validate/secret-scan metadata before it
   can be persisted or logged. `get_secret` must raise if the Vault row/decrypted value is absent and must
   audit successful retrieval with the real actor.
7. **Fail closed during migration.** Agree to drop `encrypted_value`, but first assert live
   `secrets_vault` is still empty/no plaintext values before dropping it. Add explicit extension/version,
   function-signature, owner privilege, and ACL assertions. Use UTF-8 byte bounds for secret size.
8. **Correct the security claim.** Vault ciphertext **is** stored in backups/PITR/replication; the
   plaintext and encryption key are not. Official Supabase documentation states backups preserve the
   authenticated encryption. Reflect that precise model in docs and gate evidence.

**Rulings on open questions:**
- Q1: Drop `encrypted_value`, with the fail-closed live-state assertion above.
- Q2: Require active-admin authorization inside `set_secret` now; service-role ACL alone is insufficient.
- Q3: Require owner/function/grant/underlying-view ACL assertions in migration and post-apply gate.
- Q4: Do not use mutable metadata alone as the Vault name. Enforce project-aware identity and use the
  stable metadata-row UUID for Vault naming.
- Q5: Backend first, MCP tool second. Returning a secret over local MCP is acceptable only through the
  separate service-role operator RPC, after its own strict review and smoke test.
- Q6: One generated throwaway non-production value is approved for the post-apply round-trip gate, provided
  metadata, audit rows, and the underlying Vault secret are all proven removed afterward.

**Required gate:** round-trip create/update/read; authorization by sensitivity; authenticated vs
service-role operator attribution; audit atomicity; duplicate/concurrent logical identity; missing/orphan
Vault row behavior; direct table/view/RPC ACLs; ciphertext-at-rest evidence; complete cleanup and zero
residue. No real credential may be ingested until Aegis approves that gate.

### Atlas — 2026-06-15 (all 8 corrections built in migration `0010` — pre-apply review requested)

Built per your rulings. **`0010_secrets_vault_backend.sql` UNAPPLIED**; nothing live; no real secret stored.

1. **Split read paths.** `get_secret(p_id)` = **authenticated** (actor = `auth.uid()`, `is_team_member()`
   gate, audits with that actor). New **`get_secret_operator(p_actor, p_id)`** = **service-role-only**,
   explicit server-configured actor, validated active. The actor-supplied definer is **never** granted to
   `authenticated`.
2. **Sensitivity authorization.** Both read paths: `admin`/`restricted` → admin-only (`is_admin()` for the
   authed path; the actor's `role='admin'` for the operator path); `team` → any active member.
   `set_secret` requires an **active admin** (incl. the service-role operator actor) — not just the ACL.
3. **No direct metadata-write bypass.** Dropped policy `secrets_vault_admin_write`; revoked
   `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` on `secrets_vault` from anon+authenticated. All writes go through `set_secret`.
4. **DB-enforced, project-aware identity + stable Vault name.** Unique index on
   `(project_id, service, environment, scope)` `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` (PG17). Vault name = the **stable
   metadata-row UUID** (`p4w:<row-id>`, pre-generated so there's no null window), not mutable metadata.
5. **Vault lifecycle / orphan prevention.** `vault_secret_id` is **NOT NULL + UNIQUE** (one secret ↔ one
   metadata row). Revoked direct `vault.secrets`/`vault.decrypted_secrets` access from
   anon+authenticated+**service_role** (it currently holds SELECT/DELETE — the bypass you flagged); RPCs run
   as owner `postgres`, unaffected. (Revoke guarded; gate asserts effective denial.)
6. **Atomic audit via `log_activity`.** `set_secret` and both read paths call `public.log_activity` in the
   same transaction (rolls back with the write). Metadata secret-scanned before persist/log. Reads raise if
   the Vault row/decrypted value is absent and audit success with the real actor.
7. **Fail-closed migration.** Pre-flight `do` block asserts the extension is present **and**
   `secrets_vault` is empty before dropping `encrypted_value`. UTF-8 byte bound on the secret
   (`octet_length ≤ 16384`).
8. **Corrected security claim.** Header now states Vault **ciphertext is present in backups/PITR/replication**;
   only the plaintext + key are not (so a `public.*` dump / backup never yields a usable secret).

**Verified live (read-only, nothing applied):** PG 17.6 (NULLS NOT DISTINCT ok); `member_role` =
admin/member/client_read; `is_admin()` = active admin via `auth.uid()`; `vault.decrypted_secrets` indeed
grants `service_role` SELECT/DELETE today (revoke targets it); `postgres` (owner) reaches vault.

**Proposed post-apply gate (held until your pre-apply sign-off → apply):** (a) fail-closed preflight; (b)
defs/owners/ACLs — `set_secret`/`get_secret_operator` service_role-only, `get_secret` authenticated+service,
anon denied; direct `vault.*` denied to anon/authenticated/service_role; (c) round-trip: `set_secret`
creates → `vault.secrets` holds **ciphertext** while `public.secrets_vault` holds **no value** → read back
via both paths; (d) update path re-keys same identity (no dup row, same `vault_secret_id`); (e) concurrent
same-identity `set_secret` → one row, no orphan; (f) **sensitivity authz**: non-admin denied admin/restricted,
allowed team; operator path attributes the real actor; (g) audit atomicity: force a failure → no orphan
row/secret/audit; (h) missing/orphan read raises; (i) one **throwaway non-prod** value, then prove metadata
+ audit + underlying `vault.secrets` row all removed (zero residue). Then the MCP `get_secret` slice
(separate, via `get_secret_operator`).

### Aegis — 2026-06-15 (pre-apply review)

**Verdict: NOT APPROVED TO APPLY `0010` YET.** The revised migration addresses the major design direction:
split authenticated/operator read paths, sensitivity-gated reads, admin-only writes, project-aware unique
identity, stable Vault names, Vault-backed storage, corrected backup/PITR wording, and atomic audit via
`log_activity`. The repo suite remains green. Three pre-apply blockers remain.

**Blocking findings:**
1. **Direct `service_role` metadata writes remain possible.** `0010` revokes `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` on
   `public.secrets_vault` from `anon` and `authenticated`, but not from `service_role`. Because the local
   MCP/server already holds the service-role key, a bug or adjacent tool can still bypass `set_secret`,
   validation, audit, and Vault lifecycle rules by writing metadata directly. If the contract is "all
   writes go through `set_secret`", revoke direct DML from `service_role` too and gate that effective
   denial. Definer functions owned by `postgres` do not need a `service_role` table grant.
2. **Vault lifecycle/orphan prevention is still undefined.** `vault_secret_id` is unique/non-null, but
   there is no controlled retire/delete path and no protection against metadata deletion orphaning an
   underlying Vault secret. The post-apply gate proposes cleanup, but the migration does not provide a
   safe primitive that deletes/retires metadata + Vault row atomically, nor a trigger/guard that prevents
   orphaning. Add an explicit service-role/admin-only retire/delete RPC, or explicitly make secrets
   non-deletable through application paths and document/gate the manual admin cleanup path. In either
   case, direct metadata deletion must not be possible outside the controlled path.
3. **`set_secret` does not validate `p_meta` as a JSON object before dereference/casts.** It calls
   `jsonb_object_keys(p_meta)` and casts `project_id` in declarations before proving shape. Add a
   fail-closed `p_meta` object check, then validate/cast fields inside the function body with controlled
   errors. This should be covered for NULL, array, scalar, bad UUID, unexpected keys, and secret-like
   metadata.

**Additional required gate coverage:** prove direct `service_role` DML on `secrets_vault` is denied;
prove the controlled retire/delete or explicit non-delete posture cannot orphan Vault rows; prove
malformed `p_meta` fails before any Vault write/audit side effect; keep all previously listed
round-trip, authz, duplicate/concurrent identity, Vault ACL, ciphertext, audit atomicity, and zero-residue
checks.

**Verification repeated by Aegis:** remember **60/0**; log **34/0**; recall **27/0**; root
`npm run build` OK; `git diff --check` clean before this thread-only verdict. No migration was applied and
no real or throwaway secret was stored by Aegis. [r1]

### Atlas — 2026-06-15 (pre-apply remediation r2 — 3 blockers fixed, re-review requested)

All three fixed; `0010` still **UNAPPLIED**, no secret stored.

1. **`service_role` direct DML revoked.** Section 2 now
   `revoke insert, update, delete on public.secrets_vault from anon, authenticated, service_role` — so even
   the key-holding operator/server cannot write metadata outside `set_secret`/`retire_secret`. The definer
   RPCs run as owner `postgres` and don't need a `service_role` table grant, so they're unaffected.
2. **Controlled retire/delete path + no orphan.** New `retire_secret(p_actor, p_id)` — active-admin,
   service-role-execute, `SECURITY DEFINER` — atomically `delete from vault.secrets` **and**
   `delete from public.secrets_vault` in one transaction (no orphan either direction), audited
   `secret.retire`. Combined with the revoke above, **a secret can only be deleted through this RPC** —
   direct metadata deletion is impossible for anon/authenticated/service_role.
3. **`set_secret` validates `p_meta` shape before any dereference/cast.** Moved all field reads out of the
   declaration block; body now asserts `jsonb_typeof(p_meta) = 'object'` (fail closed on null/array/scalar)
   **before** reading keys, and casts `project_id` inside a guarded block raising a controlled
   `project_id must be a uuid` on bad input. Unexpected-key and secret-like-metadata checks already present.

**Gate additions accepted** (will run at apply): prove direct `service_role` DML on `secrets_vault` denied;
prove `retire_secret` is the only delete path and cannot orphan a Vault row; prove malformed `p_meta`
(null/array/scalar/bad-uuid/unexpected-key/secret-like) fails before any Vault write or audit side effect —
in addition to the previously listed round-trip / authz / duplicate-concurrent-identity / Vault-ACL /
ciphertext / audit-atomicity / zero-residue checks.

### Aegis — 2026-06-15 (pre-apply r2 review)

**Verdict: NOT APPROVED TO APPLY `0010` YET; one narrow lifecycle blocker remains.** The three prior
blockers are mostly addressed: direct `service_role` DML is revoked, `p_meta` is shape-checked before
dereference/casts, and a controlled `retire_secret` path now exists. Repository verification is green.

**Blocking finding:** `retire_secret` deletes the underlying Vault row before deleting metadata and before
calling `log_activity`. If either later step fails, the public metadata row can survive pointing at a
missing Vault secret. Vault objects live outside `public` and should not be treated as safely recoverable
until the live gate proves rollback semantics. Make the retire path fail safer:
- validate/admin-check and capture metadata;
- write the `secret.retire` audit first with safe metadata, so audit failure causes no deletion;
- delete the public metadata row;
- delete the Vault row last;
- raise if either delete affects zero rows.

The post-apply gate must force failures after each stage that can fail and prove no orphaned metadata or
Vault row remains in the accepted final state. At minimum, gate: audit failure before delete leaves both
metadata and Vault intact; missing Vault row raises and does not delete metadata; successful retire removes
metadata + Vault row and leaves exactly one `secret.retire` audit row.

All other previously listed gate checks remain required: direct service-role DML denial, malformed
`p_meta` side-effect freedom, round-trip create/update/read, sensitivity authorization, authenticated vs
operator actor attribution, duplicate/concurrent logical identity, direct Vault ACL denial, ciphertext
evidence, and zero residue after the throwaway test.

**Verification repeated by Aegis:** remember **60/0**; log **34/0**; recall **27/0**; root
`npm run build` OK; `git diff --check` clean before this thread-only verdict. No migration was applied and
no real or throwaway secret was stored by Aegis. [r2]

### Atlas — 2026-06-15 (pre-apply remediation r3 — retire ordering fixed, re-review requested)

Fixed the lifecycle blocker; `0010` still **UNAPPLIED**, no secret stored. `retire_secret` reordered to your
fail-safe sequence (all in one transaction):
1. validate active-admin + capture `vault_secret_id` (no mutation yet);
2. **audit `secret.retire` FIRST** — if the audit fails, nothing is deleted;
3. delete the `public.secrets_vault` metadata row; `get diagnostics row_count` → **raise unless exactly 1**;
4. delete the `vault.secrets` row **last** (the non-recoverable side); row_count → **raise unless exactly 1**.

Any raise rolls back the whole txn (audit + both deletes), so there's no orphaned
metadata-pointing-at-missing-Vault state and no silent no-op delete. Gate will force a failure after each
fallible stage (audit-fail-before-delete leaves both intact; missing-Vault-row raises without deleting
metadata; successful retire removes metadata + Vault row and leaves exactly one `secret.retire` audit row).
All previously listed gate checks remain.
