# 0024 — Build Improvement Roadmap (post-Document-Factory analysis)

- **Opened:** 2026-07-01 (Atlas)
- **Status:** PLANNING — no build work authorized yet; each item below is design-first per house discipline
- **Working model for this thread (Jesse, 2026-07-01):** **Atlas plans, Sonnet 5 implements, Aegis QC-gates.**
  Atlas produces the design/spec per unit; implementation is handed to a Claude Sonnet 5 session; Aegis
  reviews before apply/deploy, as always. One unit at a time, checkpoint before proceeding.
- **Source:** full-repo analysis (docs/vision, MCP + API surface, UI + schema) run by Atlas 2026-07-01,
  HEAD `60f1eba`, migrations 0001–0022 all applied.
- **Updated 2026-07-01 (same day):** added **Pillar 5 — Memory + token-economy** (assessment of the
  two-tier memory + TOKEN-GOVERNANCE system, units P5-*) per Jesse; UI/perf quick wins renumbered to
  Pillar 6; build sequence updated to fold P5 units in.

## Verdict

The foundation is strong — governed service-role write RPCs, append-only versioning, optimistic
concurrency, two-layer secret scanning (ingress refusal + egress redaction that already caught a live
key), audited Vault, and a production-grade Document Factory loop. But **the build is still a
single-player brain with a multiplayer vision.** The highest-leverage move is the Phase-2 remote MCP
(agents + teammates plug in without key distribution), and the lead-gen opportunity is real but blocked
on a memories↔CRM bridge that does not exist yet.

## What is already excellent (do not touch)

- Write-path discipline: SECURITY DEFINER RPCs, `memory_versions` / `document_versions` history,
  mandatory `expected_updated_at` on update, provenance immutability.
- Secret governance: ingress scan refuses secret-bearing writes; `fetch` egress redaction; audited
  `get_secret` with sensitivity gates; Sealed Credential standard.
- Document Factory A–D: draft → governed scan → branded PDF → versioned private Storage → 60s signed
  download, CRM-attachable.

## Pillar 1 — Agents as first-class citizens (persistent brain for the company)

**Gap:** MCP server is local, single-operator, stdio, holding the service-role god-key. The whole
"agents across 4ward" vision is blocked here. Live contradiction: `docs/REMOTE-SETUP.md` ships the
service-role key to remote machines over TeamViewer clipboard — exactly what `MCP-PHASE2-PLAN.md`
says defeats Mnemosyne's purpose.

1. **P1-HOSTED-MCP — build Phase 2 as a *hosted remote MCP server*, not the thin local proxy in the
   plan.** Claude Code / claude.ai / most agent frameworks now speak Streamable-HTTP MCP with
   bearer/OAuth natively. Host one MCP endpoint on the existing CF Pages Functions; issue per-machine /
   per-agent tokens tied to `team_members.kind='machine'` rows with `scopes text[]`; teammates add one
   URL — zero install, zero key distribution, instant revoke. Carry over from MCP-PHASE2-PLAN unchanged:
   machine accounts, `requireMemberWithScope()`, Postgres token-bucket rate limiting. Then **delete
   REMOTE-SETUP.md**. `get_secret` stays local-operator-only (never remote), per existing plan.
2. **P1-BRIEF — `brief` MCP tool (session bootstrap).** Given a project/client name, return the RESUME
   memory + last N activity entries + open items + linked docs in ONE call. Every agent session starts
   with one cheap call instead of a recall-and-fetch dance. Biggest agent-usability win on the list.
3. **P1-HYBRID — hybrid search.** Recall is pure-vector; exact slugs, error strings, invoice numbers,
   people's names are what vector search fumbles. Add Postgres FTS alongside pgvector, fuse with
   reciprocal-rank fusion inside `recall_memory`; add optional `kind`/`tags`/`project` filters + recency
   boost. Cheap migration, large recall-quality jump.
4. **P1-BUS — `agent_messages` coordination bus** (planned since VISION, unbuilt). Moves Atlas/Aegis/
   Helios threads from git files into the DB where the dashboard and remote agents can see them.
5. **P1-LIBRARIAN — memory hygiene cron.** Flag stale entries (`verified_at` older than N months),
   near-duplicates, dead `[[links]]`; post a digest to Activity. Also build the deferred **revert RPC**
   (version history exists; rollback does not).
6. Existing open items fold in here: RAG-index rendered PDFs (Phase-D deferral) and thread `0021`
   arbitrary binary upload (needed for client files in lead-gen flows).

## Pillar 2 — Lead generation (new pillar; nothing exists today)

The "sales factory" is pipeline + document management — zero demand-gen anywhere in docs or code. But
retrieval, generation, and CRM already exist, so 4ward is ~80% of the way there.

1. **P2-BRIDGE — memories↔CRM bridge (keystone).** No FK exists between `memory_entries` and
   clients/contacts/deals. Add `client_id`/`deal_id` to memory entries (or a link table) so an agent can
   ask "everything we know about client X" and get memories + docs + deal history + activity in one
   graph. Without this the lead-gen loop cannot ground itself.
2. **P2-CRM — upgrade CRM tables to lead-gen grade.** `clients` is literally name + notes. Add industry,
   website, source (referral/inbound/outbound), status; contacts: phone/LinkedIn/title; deals:
   `next_action`, `follow_up_date`, expected close. Then a **stale-deals digest** (no activity in 14
   days → Activity feed) — cheapest revenue-protecting feature on this list.
3. **P2-LOOP — prospect-research agent loop (marquee).** Agent researches a lead on the web → writes a
   `client-brief` memory linked to the client → Document Factory generates a *tailored* capabilities
   brief / proposal grounded on past wins (RAG over prior docs already works) → attaches to the deal.
   Missing pieces: P2-BRIDGE + a `client-brief` scaffold in the doc-type catalog.
4. **P2-DRAFT — outreach drafting, not sending (yet).** Ground email drafts on the brain (SendGrid is
   the house standard when automation comes); keep sends manual for now — sequenced automation is a
   whole product and a deliverability minefield. Draft-assist captures ~80% of the value.
5. `case-study` doc type (already open item #1) feeds this pillar directly — lead-gen collateral.

## Pillar 3 — Org-specific / client-facing use

1. **P3-CLIENTREAD — activate `client_read` + sensitivity tiers.** Enum and columns exist; zero RLS
   references them. A client-scoped view (their docs, deal status, signed downloads) is a real
   differentiator. Prerequisite: the known SECURITY DEFINER debt — recall/search RPCs bypass caller RLS;
   client-facing reads need SECURITY INVOKER + RLS or in-function authz first.
2. **P3-TENANCY — strategic fork (Jesse decision).** Internal tool with client windows, vs productizable
   per-org brain deployed for clients. If the latter, decide now: org_id multi-tenancy vs
   project-per-client Supabase — retrofitting tenancy is the expensive path. **Atlas lean:
   project-per-client** (matches the existing per-client Supabase pattern, per-tenant blast radius,
   sells as "your own private brain").

## Pillar 4 — Security hygiene (prerequisites before any fan-out)

1. **Kill `docs/REMOTE-SETUP.md`** (service-role key over TeamViewer) — biggest vision-vs-reality
   contradiction in the repo.
2. **Rate limiting** — deferred in every endpoint; MCP-PHASE2-PLAN itself says "required before
   fan-out, not optional." Postgres token-bucket RPC.
3. **Neutralize the service_role vault bypass** (thread 0009 prerequisite for teammate access).
4. Open loose ends: thread `0006` IntelliTax key rotation (deferred, still open); IntelliOptics
   admin-password fallback still live in that repo's code (not this repo, tracked in memory).
5. **README ~3 phases stale** ("not yet scaffolded") — five-minute fix, matters for onboarding.

## Pillar 5 — Memory + token-economy (assessment added 2026-07-01 per Jesse)

### Assessment of what's in place

**Sound and worth keeping:**
- **Two-tier local memory** (lean `MEMORY.md` index auto-loaded + topic files read on demand +
  `/switch` orientation) — cache-aware and correct in shape.
- **TOKEN-GOVERNANCE-SYSTEM.md v1.6** is intellectually honest: §3.1 corrects the original thesis
  (the always-loaded prefix is prompt-cached at ~10% cost, so trimming it saves ~⅕ of raw size);
  §3.2 identifies **subagent search discipline as the single biggest real token lever** (file dumps
  die in the subagent; only conclusions return); §8 warns against over-engineering the framework.
- **Metadata-first MCP design**: `recall` never returns bodies; `fetch` pulls one body on demand;
  k clamped 1..50; chunk fan-out capped at 12. The token-cheap shape is already built in.

**Findings (measured 2026-07-01):**
1. **`MEMORY.md` is 18.2KB — already over its own 17KB target** and loaded into EVERY session for
   EVERY project, mostly with parked-project detail irrelevant to the active one.
2. **Only 2 of 6 spec'd hooks exist** (`governance/hooks/contracts-block.py`, `package-14day.py`).
   H3 destructive-deny, H4 SessionStart injection, H5 write-back nudge, H6 permissions allowlist are
   spec-only. Per §8's own advice this may be fine — but the doc reads as if more is enforced than is.
3. **H1 has a known false-positive bug**: it scans raw git command text, so commit MESSAGES containing
   `MOU/SOW`-like tokens get blocked on clean commits.
4. **Zero token telemetry.** §3.1 explicitly says recall-on-demand's net effect is "unproven, pending
   He1/He3 measurement" — those measurements were never run. Nothing records what agents actually
   spend, so every optimization claim is a guess.
5. **`fetch` is all-or-nothing** — pulling a 20KB body to answer a one-line question is the current
   worst-case token pattern for agents.

### Improvement units

1. **P5-TELEMETRY — measure before optimizing (build FIRST).** Log token usage per agent session/tool
   call into `activity_log` (action `agent.usage`: model, session kind, input/output/cached tokens) or
   a small `usage_log` table; dashboard tile with per-agent/per-week rollups. Finally answers the open
   He1/He3 question and makes every later P6 claim testable.
2. **P5-DIET — MEMORY.md diet + size lint.** Compress parked-project paragraphs to one-liners (detail
   already lives in topic files); add a size check to the existing PostToolUse hook on MEMORY.md edits
   (warn >16KB, block >20KB). Savings are modest (cached prefix) — justify on correctness/truncation
   risk, per §3.1.
3. **P5-H1FIX — fix the contracts-block false positive**: scan staged paths + diffed file basenames
   (Method B, already correct), not the free-text commit message. Rides in the hygiene sprint.
4. **P5-FETCH-SCOPE — section-scoped fetch.** Add optional `heading` / `max_chars` params to `fetch`
   (and the future remote MCP equivalent) so agents pull the section they need, not whole bodies.
   Pairs with P1-HYBRID: better first-hit precision = fewer recall→fetch rounds.
5. **P5-PACK — budget-capped context packs.** The P1-BRIEF `brief` tool must be server-assembled and
   HARD-capped (~4K tokens): RESUME block + last N activity + open items, dense machine-first wording
   (§16.2 style), compact JSON. One cheap call replaces every agent's recall-fan-out orientation dance.
6. **P5-AGENT-DIET — deployed-agent token rules** (bakes into P1-HOSTED-MCP + the standard AGENTS.md
   template for all repos):
   - **Scoped tool exposure**: machine accounts see only their scoped tools → fewer schemas in context.
   - **Payload caps on every MCP tool response** (bytes, not vibes); metadata-first everywhere.
   - **Search-via-subagent discipline** codified in the AGENTS.md template (the §3.2 lever, made standard).
   - **Cache-aligned harness prompts**: stable system-prompt prefixes; volatile content (brief pack)
     appended last; poll/loop intervals under the 5-min cache TTL where applicable.
   - **Model tiering**: Sonnet 5 for builds, Haiku-class for librarian/classification crons, Gemini
     Flash for the data plane. This is the first practical slice of the Phase-5 "4ward Router" vision —
     a routing config table now, the gateway later.
7. **P5-HANDOFF — session handoff standard.** Agents end long sessions by writing ONE dense handoff
   memory (§16.2 compression, verified round-trip) instead of relying on transcript compaction; next
   session boots from `brief` + handoff. Cheap convention, large repeat-session savings.

## Pillar 6 — UI/UX + performance quick wins

- **URL routing** — tabs are `useState` in `App.tsx`; no deep-linking to a deal/memory/doc.
- **Pagination + Supabase Realtime** — Memories pulls the ENTIRE table in one fetch (will fall over as
  the brain grows); Activity is one-shot `limit(200)`. Realtime on `activity_log` makes the feed live.
- **Secrets tab** — vault has NO UI; web `get_secret` RPC already exists. Admin-only tab: metadata list
  + audited reveal + set/retire. Makes the vault usable by non-CLI teammates (the point of the vault).
- **Admin team management** — Team tab is read-only; add/deactivate/role-change currently requires
  service-role surgery.
- **Documents deal-grouping fix** — string-parses `"<Deal> — …"` titles instead of using the existing
  `deal_id` FK.
- Minor: `user` kind missing as a Memories filter tab; empty-Bearer fallback in fetch helpers; React
  key collision risk in Team roster.

## Recommended sequence (cash-aware)

1. **Hygiene sprint** (days): REMOTE-SETUP kill, rate-limit RPC, README refresh, deal-grouping fix,
   **P5-H1FIX** (contracts-block false positive), **P5-DIET** (MEMORY.md diet + size lint).
   Cheap; REMOTE-SETUP + rate limiting are hard prerequisites for everything below.
2. **P5-TELEMETRY** — small unit, built BEFORE the optimizations it will judge. Every later token
   claim (and the governance doc's open He1/He3 question) becomes measurable.
3. **P1-HOSTED-MCP + P1-BRIEF** — the multiplier. Makes Mnemosyne *the company's* brain instead of
   Jesse's brain with a dashboard; directly attacks the SPOF mission. **P5-PACK** (brief budget cap)
   and **P5-AGENT-DIET** (scoped tools, payload caps, cache-aligned prompts, model tiering) are baked
   into this unit's design, not separate builds.
4. **P2-BRIDGE + P2-CRM + P1-HYBRID** (+ **P5-FETCH-SCOPE** rides with hybrid) — lead-gen foundation,
   immediately useful to the team.
5. **P2-LOOP v1** — research agent → client brief → tailored collateral → stale-deal digest. First item
   that plausibly *makes* money rather than saving time.
6. **P3 client portal / productization** — after the tenancy decision. **P5-HANDOFF** is a convention,
   not a build — adopt it in the AGENTS.md template whenever that file is next touched.

Every unit: design doc → Aegis QC → Sonnet 5 build (migrations held UNAPPLIED) → apply-go → gate →
smoke → Aegis live sign-off. Next migration number at time of writing: `0023`.

## QC — hygiene sprint (`f9083e8`, Sonnet 5) — Atlas, 2026-07-01

**Verdict: PASS with required fixes.** Code quality is good; one process violation caused a live
incident.

- **🔴 P0 — deploy-before-apply ordering violation (ACTIVE at time of QC).** The four endpoints wired
  to `checkRateLimit` fail CLOSED (500) when the `rate_take` RPC is missing. The code was pushed to
  `main` (auto-deploys, confirmed deployment `f9083e8` in CF prod) while migration `0023` was
  correctly held UNAPPLIED — so `/api/recall`, `/api/log-update`, `/api/generate-contract`,
  `/api/render-document` 500 in prod until `0023` is applied. The migration SQL itself **QC-PASSES**
  (atomic FOR UPDATE token bucket; correct refill math incl. clock-reset-on-reject; definer +
  empty search_path; service-role-only execute; explicit revoke per this project's auto-grant
  gotcha). Standing rule going forward: code that HARD-depends on an unapplied migration must not be
  pushed to an auto-deploy branch — either apply first (after QC) or make the dependency soft
  (try/catch fail-open with a logged warning) until apply.
  **→ ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-01: Jesse gave apply-go; Atlas applied `0023` via Management API.
  Post-apply gate PASSED** (fn exists; RLS on; zero anon/authenticated table grants;
  anon/authenticated cannot execute, service_role can; semantics limit=2 → take,take,reject; test
  rows cleaned). **Recovery proven live:** `/api/log-update` smoke **15/15** (incl. 201 write through
  the rate path) + `/api/render-document` valid render → **200 application/pdf, 17KB, %PDF magic**
  with a fresh member. recall/generate-contract share the identical helper wiring — recovered by
  construction.
- **🟠 P2-ORDER — rate check runs BEFORE argument validation** (surfaced by the render smoke: its ~11
  member-authenticated negative cases drained the 10-token render bucket, so the valid case 429'd;
  13/19 vs the historical 19/19). Malformed requests shouldn't burn a member's budget, and the smoke
  batteries break as written. Fix (Sonnet): in all four wired endpoints, move `checkRateLimit` to run
  AFTER cheap validation (`parseStrict` / governance scan) and immediately BEFORE the expensive work
  (embed / LLM / render / RPC write). Spend stays fully capped; negatives stop consuming tokens; the
  existing smokes pass again unmodified. Re-run `smoke-render-document.mjs` (expect 19/19) as the
  acceptance check.
- **🟠 P1 — Documents deal-grouping regression.** All 13 existing documents have `deal_id = NULL`
  (verified in prod), so the new FK-based grouping renders one big "Unassigned" bucket where the old
  title heuristic showed per-deal groups. Fix (Sonnet): fall back to the title-prefix heuristic when
  `deals?.title` is null (`d.deals?.title ?? title.split(' — ')[0]`), AND backfill links for the 13
  docs via `link_document_deal` where a matching deal exists.
- **🟡 P2 — H1 Method A misses env-var-prefixed adds** (`VAR=x git add contracts/a.pdf`) since the
  segment regex anchors on `git`. Method B (staged scan at commit) still catches it, so defense in
  depth holds. Optional tighten: allow `(\w+=\S+\s+)*` prefix in the segment regex.
- **✅ P5-DIET verified COMPLETE (correcting Atlas's initial finding):** MEMORY.md dieted AND the size
  lint exists — `check_memory_size` in `C:\Dev\build_registry_gen.py` (warn >16KB, block-notice >20KB),
  which the existing PostToolUse hook runs on every MEMORY.md edit. Atlas initially looked only in
  settings.json; withdrawn.
- **✅ Verified good:** `npm run build` green; H1 hook 7/8 targeted cases correct (both false-positive
  cases now pass; all true-positives blocked) and the INSTALLED `~/.claude` copy is the fixed version;
  `docs/setup-mnemosyne-mcp.ps1` (live service-role key) deleted from disk and was never committed
  (gitignored — no history scrub needed); REMOTE-SETUP.md removed; README now accurate.
- **🔴 Follow-up (Jesse decided 2026-07-01: left un-rotated for now):** the service-role key traveled
  to at least one remote machine under the old runbook; deleting the runbook does not un-ship it.
  Atlas position stands: **rotate before any teammate/remote rollout** (update local MCP env + CF
  Pages env + redeploy when done). Parking it is acceptable while access stays single-operator.

**Next unit design doc:** thread `0025` (P5-TELEMETRY) — ✅ BUILT + CLOSED 2026-07-02 (7/7 endpoints,
Aegis signed off; the generate-contract incident it surfaced is thread `0026`, RESOLVED same day).
**Current unit:** thread `0027` (P1-HOSTED-MCP + P1-BRIEF, sequence step 3) — design WRITTEN
2026-07-02, awaiting Aegis review; migration # `0026`; **service-role key rotation is a deploy gate
inside that unit** (Aegis re-flagged at the 0025 signoff).
