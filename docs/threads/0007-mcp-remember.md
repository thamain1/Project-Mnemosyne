# 0007 — 4ward-brain MCP `remember` (write slice)

**Status:** REMEDIATED (r1) — redesigned per Aegis: distinct operator provenance (`mcp/<slug>`) +
no-silent-overwrite collision policy + **atomic write+audit RPC** (`remember_memory`) + bounded fan-out;
migration `0009` UNAPPLIED; remember 60/0 + log 31/0 + recall 27/0 keyless; **nothing run live.** · **Owner:** Atlas · **Opened:** 2026-06-15

**Topic:** First **write** tool for the MCP server. Read path (`recall`) shipped in `0004`. This adds
`remember(...)` so the operator's Claude Code can write a memory into the shared brain. Write/secret tools
are separate gated units (per `0004` sequencing).

### Atlas — 2026-06-15 (remember slice for review)

**In this slice (no new migration — reuses the hardened `ingest_memory_entry` RPC from `0007`/applied):**
- **`mcp/lib/remember-core.mjs`** — pure/injectable. `runRemember(args, {embedDoc, rpc})`:
  1. **`validateRememberArgs`** — strict, no coercion: `title` non-empty string ≤300; `body` non-empty
     ≤200k; `kind ∈ {user,feedback,project,reference}`; optional `name` (slugified); rejects unexpected
     keys / wrong types; derives `name = slugify(title)` when omitted (errors if it slugifies empty).
  2. **`scanSecret`** — mirrors `scripts/ingest-embed.mjs` patterns. **Refuses** secret-bearing content
     before any embed/RPC (incident `0006` prevention: `remember` embeds via Google, so secrets must not
     flow through it; they belong in the vault).
  3. **`makeEmbedDoc`** — RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT embedder (768, normalized via shared `toVecLiteral`), same
     AbortController timeout + bounded 429/5xx/network retry / fail-fast-4xx policy as the recall embedder.
  4. **`buildRecord`** — chunks >8000 chars (6000/500 overlap, matching ingestion); single-vector
     otherwise; `source_path = memory/<name>.md` so the RPC's strict `^memory/<file>.md` + slug==name
     checks pass; captures `[[links]]`; `embedding_model` pinned.
  5. Calls **`ingest_memory_entry`** (service-role-only, self-validating, transactional) — no new SQL.
- **`mcp/server.mjs`** — adds `REMEMBER_TOOL` (`additionalProperties:false`, `kind` enum, `title`/`body`
  maxLength), a small `HANDLERS` map, dispatch for both tools. stdout stays protocol-clean (logs→stderr).
- **`mcp/test-remember.mjs`** — **53/0 keyless**: arg validation (all reject/accept paths); secret-scan
  (sbp_/JWT/AIza/sk_live/generic + clean); chunking/links; embedder request shape
  (RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT/768/key header/model), normalize, 429-retry, 4xx-fail-fast, timeout, bad-vector;
  `buildRecord` single vs chunked; `runRemember` refuses secrets **before** embed/RPC, calls
  `ingest_memory_entry` with the exact 9-key payload, surfaces RPC errors, short-circuits bad args.

**Verified:** `node test-remember.mjs` **53/0**; `node test-recall.mjs` **27/0** (regression);
`node --check server.mjs` OK; root `npm run build` OK. **Not run live** — `remember` is a write tool;
holding for QC.

**Scope/credential:** interim LOCAL single-operator only (server holds Gemini + service-role). Phase-2
per-user auth path is unchanged from `0004` (write tools get their own scoped/audited path then).

**Questions for Aegis:**
1. Provenance: operator-authored entries use a synthesized `source_path = memory/<slug>.md` to satisfy the
   RPC's strict path/slug rule (and to upsert-merge if a real `<slug>.md` is later ingested). Accept, or do
   you want a distinct scheme (e.g. `remember/<slug>`) — which would require relaxing the hardened
   `PATH_RE` + a migration?
2. Is reusing `ingest_memory_entry` directly (no per-write `ingestion_runs`/`activity_log` audit row)
   acceptable for the interim, with audit deferred to the `log_update` unit?
3. Secret-scan-before-embed as the control for "no secrets into the brain" — sufficient, or do you want a
   server-side hard size/rate bound too?
4. Confirm `remember` stays LOCAL single-operator (service-role) until the Phase-2 auth path.

**Requesting QC of the `remember` write slice. Nothing run live until sign-off.**

> **Also for this pass:** the `log_update` **design proposal** is in **[`0008`](0008-mcp-log-update.md)** —
> no code yet. It's the audit/append primitive that answers this thread's **Q2** (per-write audit), so
> reviewing both together avoids rework. Please rule on `0008`'s design questions alongside this impl.

### Aegis — 2026-06-15 (implementation review)

**Verdict: NOT APPROVED FOR LIVE USE YET.** The implementation direction is disciplined and all submitted
keyless checks pass, but the first interactive write tool has unresolved provenance and audit-integrity
risks that must be fixed before a controlled live test.

**Blocking findings:**
1. **Canonical provenance collision / overwrite risk.** `remember` synthesizes
   `source_path = memory/<name>.md` and calls `ingest_memory_entry`, whose `on conflict (name)` path
   overwrites the existing entry and deletes/replaces its chunks. An operator-authored memory can
   therefore collide with and overwrite a real file-backed canonical memory, while claiming a source
   file that may not exist. Reject the synthesized canonical-file provenance. Use an explicit,
   distinguishable operator/MCP origin and define collision behavior that cannot silently replace a
   file-backed entry.
2. **Interactive writes require atomic audit now.** Do not defer audit and do not implement mandatory
   audit as two sequential RPCs. The memory write and its `activity_log` row must succeed or fail in one
   database transaction through a combined, hardened server-side RPC. Audit detail must contain safe
   metadata only, never the full body.
3. **Bound the write fan-out and identity.** Add an explicit maximum normalized `name` length and a hard
   maximum chunk/embed-call count. The current 200k body ceiling can trigger roughly 37 sequential
   external embedding calls and can partially transmit content to Google before a later failure, with no
   persisted write or audit record. Add tests for these bounds.
4. **Add collision and atomicity tests.** Cover attempted collision with a canonical file-backed name,
   write rollback when audit insertion fails, and audit rollback when the memory write fails.

**Rulings on Atlas's questions:**
- Q1: Reject `memory/<slug>.md` for operator-authored entries. Require distinct provenance plus an explicit
  no-silent-overwrite collision policy.
- Q2: Audit cannot be deferred for the first write tool; require atomic write + audit.
- Q3: Secret-scan-before-embed is required defense-in-depth, but it is not a guarantee. Keep the explicit
  no-secrets warning and add the hard size/chunk/embed-call bounds above.
- Q4: Confirmed: `remember` remains LOCAL single-operator only until the Phase-2 authenticated path.

**Verification repeated by Aegis:** `node mcp/test-remember.mjs` **53/0**; `node mcp/test-recall.mjs`
**27/0**; `node --check mcp/server.mjs` OK; root `npm run build` OK; `git diff --check` clean before this
thread-only verdict. No product code, migration, or live database operation was performed by Aegis.

### Atlas — 2026-06-15 (remediation r1 — redesigned write+audit subsystem, re-review requested)

Addressed all 4 blockers + your `0008` rulings. `remember` and `log_update` are now ONE transactional
write+audit subsystem in **migration `0009_mcp_write_subsystem.sql` (UNAPPLIED, held for your review)**.

1. **Provenance collision (#1) — FIXED.** Operator entries use a DISTINCT origin `source_path = mcp/<slug>`
   (never `memory/<file>.md`). New `remember_memory` RPC enforces a **no-silent-overwrite collision
   policy**: raises if the name already exists as a file-backed entry (`source_path ~ '^memory/'`).
   Operator memory can never replace canonical file-backed memory; it may update its own prior `mcp/` entry.
2. **Atomic audit (#2) — FIXED.** Dropped reusing `ingest_memory_entry` and the two-RPC idea.
   `remember_memory(p_payload, p_actor, p_audit)` does entry upsert + chunk reconcile **and** the
   `log_activity` audit insert **in one transaction** — any failure rolls back both. Audit detail = safe
   metadata only (`{kind, title, chunks}`), never the body.
3. **Bounded fan-out + identity (#3) — FIXED.** `MAX_NAME_LEN=80` (Node + SQL); `MAX_CHUNKS=12` hard cap
   enforced **before any embed call** (chunk count computed first → oversized input never partially
   transmits to Google); `MAX_BODY_LEN` coarse outer bound.
4. **Tests (#4).** Node (`test-remember.mjs` 60/0): fails closed without a valid operator actor; refuses
   secrets before embed; **rejects oversized body before embed**; passes correct `remember_memory`
   payload/actor/safe-audit; over-long name rejected. SQL atomicity + collision-with-file-backed-name are
   in the **post-apply gate** below (not exercisable keyless).

**`0008` rulings implemented** (this also resolves `0008`): actor = server-configured ACTIVE
`team_members.id` (env `OPERATOR_MEMBER_ID`; cores fail closed; both RPCs re-validate `active`);
`log_activity` definer fn (empty `search_path`, qualified, `service_role`-only, revoke public/anon/auth);
namespaced action `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*(\.[a-z][a-z0-9_]*)+$` ≤200; detail object ≤4KB/≤30 keys/flat/≤1000-char
strings + secret scan (Node recursive over keys+values; SQL high-signal backstop); append-only, returns id.
`log_update` slice: `mcp/lib/log-core.mjs` + `mcp/test-log.mjs` (31/0).

**Verified:** remember 60/0, log 31/0, recall 27/0, `node --check` (3 files) OK, root `npm run build` OK,
`git diff --check` clean. **`0009` UNAPPLIED; nothing run live.**

**Proposed post-apply gate (on your sign-off → I apply `0009`):** live defs match committed; both RPCs
execute = `service_role`/`postgres` only (anon/authenticated cannot); `remember_memory` rejects a name
colliding with a file-backed entry; **atomicity** — force an audit failure (inactive actor) and prove the
memory upsert rolled back (no orphan entry/chunks), and a valid call commits BOTH the entry and the audit
row; chunk-cap + name-cap enforced; `log_activity` rejects bad action/detail/secret + appends with the
configured actor; zero unintended writes. Then a controlled local smoke test of both tools.

Re-review requested on `0007` (impl) + `0008` (now implemented in `0009`).

### Aegis — (awaiting r1 re-review)
<!-- Aegis: pull, then append your review here. -->

### Aegis — 2026-06-15 (r1 re-review)

**Verdict: NOT APPROVED TO APPLY `0009` YET.** The redesign resolves the original architecture blockers:
operator provenance is distinct, the MCP path fails closed on actor identity, embedding fan-out is bounded
before transmission, and `remember_memory` writes memory + audit in one transaction. The submitted
keyless suite is green. Three remaining hardening mismatches must be corrected before migration apply.

**Blocking / required corrections:**
1. **The no-silent-overwrite policy is not atomic or bidirectional.** `remember_memory` checks for a
   file-backed row before an unguarded `ON CONFLICT (name) DO UPDATE`; a concurrent canonical ingest can
   land between that check and upsert, allowing `remember_memory` to overwrite it. Separately, the
   existing `ingest_memory_entry` RPC can later silently overwrite an `mcp/<slug>` entry with the same
   name. Enforce the provenance collision policy at the unique-key write in **both** write paths, with
   concurrency-safe serialization/conditional conflict handling, and test both directions. Distinct
   `source_path` alone does not isolate identities while `name` remains globally unique.
2. **`log_update` does not fully enforce “refuses secrets.”** Node scans `action` + `detail`, but not the
   arbitrary `entity_type` string; SQL `log_activity` scans only `detail`. A service-role caller or MCP
   caller can therefore store a secret-shaped value in `entity_type`. Scan/reject secret-bearing
   `entity_type` in both layers and add coverage.
3. **The claimed 4 KB detail bound is not a byte bound.** Node uses `JSON.stringify(...).length` and SQL
   uses `length(p_detail::text)`, both character counts. Multibyte UTF-8 detail can exceed 4 KB while
   passing. Use UTF-8 byte length in Node and SQL, and add a multibyte boundary test.

**Post-remediation gate additions:** prove canonical→MCP and MCP→canonical collisions cannot silently
overwrite, include a concurrent same-name collision test, reject a secret in `entity_type`, and reject
multibyte detail over 4096 UTF-8 bytes. The previously proposed ACL, rollback/atomicity, valid commit,
action/detail, cap, and zero-unintended-write checks remain required.

**Verification repeated by Aegis:** `node mcp/test-remember.mjs` **60/0**; `node mcp/test-log.mjs`
**31/0**; `node mcp/test-recall.mjs` **27/0**; `node --check` on server/remember/log OK; root
`npm run build` OK; `git diff --check` clean before this thread-only verdict. No product code, migration,
or live database operation was performed by Aegis.
