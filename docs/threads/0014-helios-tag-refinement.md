# 0014 — Helios tag refinement pass (memory_entries.tags)

**Status:** OPEN · **Owner:** Helios · **Opened:** 2026-06-15 by Atlas
**Topic:** Deepen the B+.2 baseline tags with judgment-based classification — accurate `code-snippet`
identification, cross-project **`applies-to:<project>`** reuse links, and cleaner `topic:` grouping for
feedback/reference. **Helios proposes; Atlas reviews + applies (MERGE, never overwrite).**

### Atlas — 2026-06-15 (handoff to Helios)

Migration `0011` is live; `memory_entries.tags` is backfilled with a deterministic **baseline** (118/118):
`project:<slug>`, `repo:<name>`, `topic:<token>`, `reusable`, `code-snippet`. The baseline is accurate for
project/repo but **`topic:` is noisy** (e.g. `topic:no`, `topic:two`, `topic:multi`) and `code-snippet` is a
coarse keyword guess. Your job is the judgment layer.

**Worklist:** the **`reference` (20)** and **`feedback` (42)** entries — these are the cross-cutting, reusable
ones where classification needs reading the content. (Leave `project` entries' `project:`/`repo:` tags as-is —
those are correct.)

**For each, PROPOSE tag refinements:**
- **`code-snippet`** — set true only if the entry actually contains a reusable code pattern/snippet meant to
  be lifted into another project (not just prose advice). Correct the baseline's false positives/negatives.
- **`applies-to:<project-slug>`** — NEW tag: which projects this reference/pattern is usable in or was drawn
  from (cross-project reuse links — the valuable part). Use the known project slugs (onthehash, intellitax,
  mentorapp, mnemosyne, intelliservice, intellioptics, impacttracker, perks, allsigns, pallets, …).
- **`topic:<token>`** — replace noisy single-word topics with a meaningful one (e.g. `topic:no` →
  `topic:contracts`; `topic:supabase`/`topic:cf` are already fine).
- Keep `reusable` on genuine building blocks; drop it where it's prose-only.

**HARD RULES:**
- **Secret-scan every body BEFORE reading/sending it to the API** (you process content via Google). If an
  entry trips the secret denylist (`sbp_`, `sb_secret_`, `eyJ…` JWT, `AIza…`, `sk_live/test`, `xox`, PEM,
  `service_role`), **quarantine it — do NOT read/classify/send it**, and report it. (We've been burned: an
  entry held a live key once.)
- **MERGE semantics:** you PROPOSE a tag delta per entry (tags to add / tags to remove); you do **NOT**
  rewrite the whole array. Atlas applies via a merge that **preserves** existing correct tags. The baseline
  backfill script must NOT be rerun (it overwrites).
- **You propose only** — write `docs/helios/tag-refinement.md` (one section per entry: name, current tags,
  +adds, −removes, one-line rationale) + a `### Helios — <date>` summary here. **No DB writes**, no edits to
  canonical memory files / migrations / governance.

**Output / done:** `docs/helios/tag-refinement.md` covering the 62 reference+feedback entries (minus any
quarantined) + thread summary. Then Atlas reviews → applies the merge → dashboard code-library + cross-project
`applies-to` links get accurate. Commit + push coordination artifacts (standing auth); trailer
`Co-Authored-By: Helios (Gemini) <helios@4wardmotions.com>`.
