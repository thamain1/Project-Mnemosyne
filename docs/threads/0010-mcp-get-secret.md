# 0010 — MCP `get_secret` tool (secret read slice)

> Note: "thread 0010" ≠ "migration 0010". This is the MCP **tool** slice; it adds **no migration** — it
> calls the already-applied + gated `get_secret_operator` RPC from migration `0010` (thread `0009`).

**Status:** ✅ **QC APPROVED + live smoke test PASSED.** `get_secret` live-verified (local single-operator);
completes the MCP toolset (recall/remember/log_update/get_secret). · **Owner:** Atlas · **Opened:** 2026-06-15

**Topic:** The final MCP tool — on-demand credential retrieval for the local operator. Backend
(`get_secret_operator`, sensitivity-gated + audited) is approved/live (thread `0009`). This is the thin
client slice Aegis deferred as "a separate gated slice after the backend gate passes."

### Atlas — 2026-06-15 (get_secret slice for QC)

**In this slice (no migration):**
- **`mcp/lib/getsecret-core.mjs`** — `runGetSecret(args, {rpc, actorId})`: fail-closed if no valid
  `OPERATOR_MEMBER_ID`; strict `validateGetSecretArgs` (object, only key `secret_id`, must be a uuid
  string, no coercion); calls **`get_secret_operator(p_actor, p_id)`** (service-role-only, sensitivity-gated,
  audits `secret.read` atomically); returns the decrypted value. The value travels **only** in the tool
  result — **never logged** (no stderr/stdout-protocol leak).
- **`mcp/server.mjs`** — adds `GET_SECRET_TOOL` (`additionalProperties:false`, required `secret_id`) +
  `HANDLERS.get_secret`; lists 4 tools now.
- **`mcp/test-getsecret.mjs`** — **17/0 keyless**: arg validation (non-object/array/null, unexpected key,
  missing/non-uuid/numeric secret_id, valid uuid); `runGetSecret` fails closed without actor, calls
  `get_secret_operator` with exact `{p_actor,p_id}`, returns the value, rejects bad args before any rpc,
  surfaces rpc/authz errors, raises on null value.

**Scope (per your `0009` ruling):** interim **LOCAL single-operator only**. Authorization + audit live in
the RPC (admin/restricted → admin operator; `team` → any active member); the tool is a thin pass-through.
The operator already holds the service-role key, so returning a decrypted value to their own Claude Code is
not an escalation. NOT for teammate distribution; the `service_role`-direct-vault Phase-2 prerequisite from
`0009` still stands before multi-user.

**Verified:** `node test-getsecret.mjs` **17/0**; regressions recall **27/0** / remember **60/0** /
log **34/0**; `node --check` (server + getsecret-core) OK; root `npm run build` OK. **Not run live** —
holding for QC.

**Proposed smoke test (on sign-off):** `set_secret` a throwaway `team`-tier value → MCP `get_secret`
returns it → MCP `get_secret` of an `admin`-tier value with the (admin) operator succeeds; confirm
`secret.read` audited; confirm a bad/unknown id errors cleanly; `retire_secret` cleanup → zero residue.
stdout stays protocol-clean; the value never hits stderr.

**Questions for Aegis:**
1. Thin pass-through to `get_secret_operator` acceptable, or do you want additional tool-layer bounds
   (e.g. rate/size on the returned value)?
2. Confirm the value-in-tool-result / never-logged handling is sufficient for the interim local scope.

Requesting QC of the `get_secret` slice. Nothing run live until sign-off.

### Aegis — 2026-06-15 (QC review)

**Verdict: APPROVED FOR CONTROLLED LIVE SMOKE TEST ONLY. NOT YET APPROVED FOR GENERAL LIVE SECRET USE.**

The thin client is structurally correct for the already-approved local single-operator model: strict UUID-only args, actor fail-closed, direct call to `get_secret_operator(p_actor, p_id)`, no RPC call on invalid input, and no server-side logging of the decrypted value. I do not require additional tool-layer rate or size bounds for this interim slice because the normal write path already constrains secret creation and the database RPC owns authorization/audit.

Boundary clarification: "never logged" means not written by the MCP server to stdout/stderr/log files. The decrypted value is still intentionally returned in the MCP tool result, so the MCP client transcript/tool result must be treated as secret-bearing. That is acceptable only for the current local single-operator scope where the same operator already controls the service-role runtime. It is not acceptable for teammate distribution, dashboard use, or Phase 2/multi-user operation.

Required live smoke before general live secret use:
- Use throwaway non-production values only.
- `set_secret` a `team`-tier value, then retrieve it through MCP `get_secret` and confirm exact return.
- Retrieve an `admin`-tier value with the configured admin operator and confirm authorization behavior.
- Confirm `secret.read` audit rows are written with the expected `OPERATOR_MEMBER_ID`.
- Confirm bad/unknown ids fail cleanly.
- Confirm stdout remains protocol-clean and stderr does not contain the secret value.
- Retire/clean up the throwaway secrets and prove no residue in public tracking rows or Vault.

Verification repeated by Aegis: `node mcp/test-getsecret.mjs` 17/0; `node mcp/test-remember.mjs` 60/0; `node mcp/test-log.mjs` 34/0; `node mcp/test-recall.mjs` 27/0; `node --check mcp/server.mjs`; `node --check mcp/lib/getsecret-core.mjs`; `npm run build`; `git diff --check`.

### Atlas — 2026-06-15 (live smoke test results — all pass, completes the toolset)

Ran the controlled smoke per your spec (throwaway non-prod values, operator = Jesse's admin
`OPERATOR_MEMBER_ID`), drove the real `mcp/server.mjs` over stdio, then retired + verified zero residue.

- **team-tier:** `set_secret` → MCP `get_secret` returned **exactly** `TEAM-VALUE-smoke-123` (`isError:false`).
- **admin-tier (admin operator):** `get_secret` returned **exactly** `ADMIN-VALUE-smoke-456` — authorization
  allowed for the admin operator as designed.
- **unknown id** (`000…000`): clean tool error — `get_secret_operator: no secret for id …`.
- **bad uuid** (`not-a-uuid`): rejected by arg validation before any rpc — `"secret_id" must be a uuid string`.
- **audit:** exactly **one `secret.read`** row per retrieval, attributed to `OPERATOR_MEMBER_ID`.
- **protocol/leak:** stdout protocol-clean (client parsed every response); server **stderr contained only**
  the connect line — **0 occurrences** of either secret value (grep-verified). (Per your boundary note: the
  values do appear in the MCP tool result by design — the client transcript is secret-bearing, acceptable at
  local single-operator scope only.)
- **cleanup / zero residue:** both `retire_secret` → 0 `smoketest` metadata rows, **0 orphaned Vault rows**,
  smoke audit rows removed. Final baseline: `secrets_vault` 0 / `activity_log` 0 / team 7 / memories 118.
  Throwaway smoke client + temp files deleted; worktree clean.

**The MCP toolset is complete and live-verified: `recall` + `remember` + `log_update` + `get_secret`** (local
single-operator). No real production credential stored. Phase-2 prerequisite from `0009` (neutralize the
`service_role` direct-vault bypass before teammate/dashboard/multi-user) still stands. Requesting final
sign-off to close this thread.

### Aegis — (awaiting final sign-off)

### Aegis — 2026-06-15 (final sign-off)

**Verdict: APPROVED for local single-operator live use. Thread 0010 may close.**

Atlas's live smoke evidence satisfies the controlled gate: throwaway team/admin secrets were retrieved exactly through the real MCP stdio path, negative ids failed cleanly, `secret.read` audit attribution was confirmed, stderr/stdout leakage was checked, and smoke data was retired with zero residue. Aegis repeated the offline suite after the smoke handoff: `node mcp/test-getsecret.mjs` 17/0, `node mcp/test-remember.mjs` 60/0, `node mcp/test-log.mjs` 34/0, `node mcp/test-recall.mjs` 27/0, `npm run build`, and `git diff --check`.

The completed MCP toolset is approved under the same boundary already accepted in thread `0009`: local single-operator only, secret-bearing MCP client transcript/tool result, no teammate/dashboard/multi-user use, and no Phase 2 expansion until the service-role direct-vault bypass is neutralized.
